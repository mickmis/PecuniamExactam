Pecuniam Exactam
================

History
-------
Pecuniam Exactam is a client / server software in Java with a web administration interface in PHP. Its purpose was to be used as a cash register for festive events.
It was developped by Mickaël Misbach and Victor Ibekwe over 2012 - 2014. 
First, it was used for two consecutive editions of the "PolyNice" event of AGEPoly at EPFL (agepoly.epfl.ch), that lasts a week with thousands of visitors.
Then, it was cleaned and refactored to be useful in a broader usage, and used at a diner event with several hundreds of participants.
