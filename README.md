Pecuniam Exactam
================

History
-------
Pecuniam Exactam is a client / server software in Java with a web administration interface in PHP. Its purpose is to be used as a cash register for events.
It was initially developped by MickaÃ«l Misbach - mickael@misba.ch (Java client and server) and Victor Ibekwe - ibekwe.victor@gmail.com (PHP web administration interface). At first for the "PolyNice" event of AGEPoly of EPFL (agepoly.epfl.ch), and successfully used for two editions, it was then cleaned and refactored to be useful in a broader usage.
